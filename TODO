    Crosslink and index: copy all module docs into a single directory,
    parse out class info from all json files and use to generate the
    index, and links that could not be created when docs where generated
    outside of this environment.  Or the program could accept a series
    of output locations and not copy into a single directory. The problem
    with this is that we don't know the relative path that needs to be
    used for a module.

    Inheritance data for YAHOO.augment

    New comment block types for YAHOO.augment implementations ... 
    EventPublish and Config.  Since these have properties that are not
    directly discoverable by the doc tool, and because these properties
    can't be accessed like a normal property, we need a way to document
    these that describe how they are used.

    Hide private classes and files

    Consider changing the output format to use all arrays instead of
    a mix of arrays and dictionaries.  For instance, the list of params
    has to be an array to keep the order, whereas classes, properties
    and methods get sorted so it doesn't matter.  Dictionaries are used
    when possible because of cross-referencing I needed during the parse,
    but this is no doubt more difficult to use than an all array format.
