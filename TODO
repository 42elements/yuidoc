    Consider changing the json output format to use all arrays instead of a mix
    of arrays and dictionaries.  For instance, the list of params has to be an
    array to keep the order, whereas classes, properties and methods get sorted
    so it doesn't matter.  Dictionaries are used when possible because of
    cross-referencing I needed during the parse, but this is no doubt more
    difficult to use than an all array format.
