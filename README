yuidoc README

yuidoc is a set of tools to generate the API documentation for the JavaScript
in the YUI library.  The docs are derived completely from JavaDoc style
comment blocks; no attempt is made to understand the javascript itself.

The tools are written in python, and should work for version 2.3 and up.  
To date, it has only been tested in version 2.3 on a unix system.  Although
largely untested, it should work in MS windows as well.

The following python libraries are required:
    simplejson - for reading and writing json
    cheetah    - for generating the html docs
    pygments   - for colorizing the source
