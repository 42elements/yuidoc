One-time setup for python:

If simplejson and/or cheetah are not installed, unarchive the files in
the ext directory and follow the supplied instructions to install the
packages.

Unix (including cygwin):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extract each of the archives in ext and install the package
sudo python setup.py install (no sudo needed for cygwin or windows)

setuptools
    cd ext
    tar xfvz setuptools-0.6c3.tar.gz
    cd setuptools-0.6c3
    sudo python setup.py install

pygments
    cd ext
    tar xfvz pygments.tar.gz
    cd pygments
    sudo python setup.py install

simplejson
    cd ext
    tar xfvz simplejson-1.4.tar.gz
    cd simplejson-1.4
    sudo python setup.py install

cheetah
    cd ext
    tar xfvz Cheetah-2.0rc7.tar.gz
    cd Cheetah-2.0rc7
    sudo python setup.py install


Get yuidoc: cvs co yahoo/presentation/tools/yuidoc

Make a copy of yuidoc/bin/example.sh and modify the paths to suit your needs.

See TAGS for a brief description of the supported tags.  Checking out the
source for the YUI library is a good way to get to know how it works. Ex:
http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/docs/Event.js.html

NOTE: This tool will generally work with code that has been commented for
jsdoc, with one exception:  you must have at least one @module block defined
somewhere in your source.  If you don't, the program will run but won't
generate anything.


DOS/Windows:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EITHER

Extract my version of python that has all of the needed support libs to C:\

  * http://produce.yahoo.com/adamoore/Python24.zip

OR

  * Use Python 2.4.3 as 2.5 generates warnings because the json parser has 
    not been updated yet:

        http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.4.3/python-2.4.3.msi

  * Extract each of the archives with WinZIP and install as described in 
    the unix section.

  * Copy _namemapper.pyd to C:\Python24\Lib\site-packages\Cheetah


In either case, add C:\python24 to your PATH

Get yuidoc: cvs co yahoo/presentation/tools/yuidoc

Copy yuidoc\bin\example.bat and modify the paths to suit your needs
