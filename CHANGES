 - Method return values now show up even if you do not provide a description
   for the return

Version 0.0.2 (10/16/06, adamoore)
-------------
 - Supports @event blocks.  These blocks are similar to method blocks, but
   they do not have @return values, and the @params refer to the signature
   the event listeners will receive.

 - Supports @config blocks.  These blocks are the same as @property blocks.
   Configuration options are presented in a separate block from the
   normal properties.

 - @requires is supported on the module splash page
   
 - If @method/@property is not provided in the comment block, the parser will
   now try to guess the name and type by parsing the code following the block.

 - Added @protected support.  Use for properties/methods that are intended to
   be private for all except subclasses.
