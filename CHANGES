ChangeLog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 0.0.5 (10/23/06, adamoore)
-------------
 - Now supports multiple source trees.  Each source tree is treated as a separate
   module, and as long as each tree has a @module block, it will generate
   the docs correctly for each block and handle inheritance info across modules.
   Note: if you do not include a module block, the class documentation won't be
   generated.

 - index.html is now a landing page for the documentation for the entire library.
   The current landing page is a placeholder until we come up with something
   good.

 - The module name is now expected to be the short name corresponding to the
   directory your module lives in.  @module now has an additional @title
   tag that you can use to specify the friendly name for the module that shows
   in the documentation.  For example:

    /**
     * The Slider component is a UI control that enables the user to adjust 
     * values in a finite range along one or two axes.
     *
     * @module    slider
     * @title     Slider Widget
     * @namespace YAHOO.widget
     * @requires  yahoo,dom,dragdrop,event
     * @optional  animation
     */

 - generator.py now accepts a -s option for showing privates.

 - static properties/methods/etc no longer show up in the inheritance sections

 - Fixed the output for events

Version 0.0.4 (10/17/06, adamoore)
-------------
 - Added @final for constants and read-only configs

 - Added @default to highlight default values for properties and configs

 - Added @uses for generating YAHOO.augment inheritance info

Version 0.0.3 (10/16/06, adamoore)
-------------
 - Method return values now show up even if you do not provide a description
   for the return

 - CSS fix for IE code view

Version 0.0.2 (10/16/06, adamoore)
-------------
 - Supports @event blocks.  These blocks are similar to method blocks, but
   they do not have @return values, and the @params refer to the signature
   the event listeners will receive.

 - Supports @config blocks.  These blocks are the same as @property blocks.
   Configuration options are presented in a separate block from the
   normal properties.

 - @requires is supported on the module splash page
   
 - If @method/@property is not provided in the comment block, the parser will
   now try to guess the name and type by parsing the code following the block.

 - Added @protected support.  Use for properties/methods that are intended to
   be private for all except subclasses.

Version 0.0.1 (10/2/06, adamoore)
